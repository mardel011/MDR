        <h1 class="top">Hello!</h1>
        <div class="img-about">
            <div class="first">I'm currently a Blockchain Development student at George Brown College.
                Over the past few months, I've learned about full stack development, solidity, software methodology, and decentralized
                applications.
                <br>
                <br>
                This summer, I've had the chance to speak with industry professionals in the compliance and AML
                communities. After learning quite a bit, I'm hoping I can learn more by joining this space as a blockchain 
                compliance analyst and investigator. I'm currently seeking a co-op opportunity for this September, 
                so I've created my own job description which you can read about <a class="one" href="MariamJobDescription.pdf">here</a> 
                and my resume which is also attached <a class= "one" href="MariamResume.pdf">here</a>.
            </div>
            <div class="first">
                A little bit about me:
                <ul>
                    <li>I have a degree in criminology and history from the University of Toronto.</li>
                    <li>My work experience is in retail and telecommunications.</li>
                    <li>I volunteer and advocate for those who are incarcerated, facing domestic violence, experiencing 
                        mental health issues, and homelessness.</li>
                    <li>I'm always continually learning!</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="first">Fun facts about my website:
                <ul>
                    <li>I made this all by myself! I'm always looking to improve my skills, so you'll see me updating
                        this site from time to time.</li>
                    <li>I love reading! So it was only fitting that my homepage featured books. My homepage image is
                        actually the Seattle Library, which I've been to, twice!</li>
                    <li>My pink and green theme is based on my favourite fruit, a watermelon.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="first">Thanks for stopping by!</div>
